# Airbnb Listing Price Predictor

## Introduction
The Airbnb Price Predictor project aims to build a predictive model that can accurately forecast the price of Airbnb listings based on various features. This model will help both new and existing hosts set competitive prices and guests find the best value for their money. The project leverages machine learning to offer data-driven insights for optimizing listing prices.

## Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive tool designed to empower Airbnb hosts by optimizing their listing prices for success. The key components of the project include:

- **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Feature Engineering**
- **Model Development**
- **Model Evaluation**
- **Deployment**

## The Challenge
In the dynamic world of Airbnb hosting, setting the right price is crucial. Price too high, and you miss potential bookings; too low, and you're leaving money on the table. This project addresses the dilemma faced by hosts by providing a solution that balances attractiveness to guests with profitability for hosts.

## The Solution: Airbnb Price Predictor
The Airbnb Price Predictor is a machine learning model designed to help new hosts price their listings accurately and enable existing hosts to adjust prices to maximize bookings. It considers various factors such as location, property type, amenities, and host reputation, ensuring a comprehensive approach to pricing.

## How It Works
### Data Collection and Preprocessing
Data was sourced from [Inside Airbnb: Get the Data](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html). The data collection phase involved understanding elements that significantly impact pricing, such as location, amenities, and host reputation.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was performed to understand the distribution of data, identify patterns, and uncover relationships between different features and the target variable (price). Visualizations and summary statistics were used to gain insights.

### Feature Engineering
Relevant features were engineered to improve the model's performance. This included creating new variables, transforming existing features, and selecting the most impactful features for prediction.

### Model Development
Leveraging machine learning algorithms, several models were tested, including:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Gradient Boosting Machines
- XGBoost

The models were evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) to determine their performance.

### Model Evaluation
The best-performing model was selected based on evaluation metrics and cross-validation results. Hyperparameter tuning was conducted to optimize the model further.

### User-Friendly Interface
A Streamlit web application was developed to deploy the price prediction model. Users can input details about an Airbnb listing, and the app will predict the expected price based on the trained model.
